# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview

In this project, I had the opportunity to create and optimize an Azure ML pipeline. I have been provided a custom-coded modelâ€”a standard Scikit-learn Logistic Regression--which  hyperparameters I optimized using HyperDrive. I also used AutoML to build and optimize a model on the same dataset, so that I can compare the results of the two methods.

You can see the main steps that I have taken in the diagram below:

## Summary
**In 1-2 sentences, explain the problem statement: e.g "This dataset contains data about... we seek to predict..."**

**In 1-2 sentences, explain the solution: e.g. "The best performing model was a ..."**

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**

## Proof of cluster clean up
**If you did not delete your compute cluster in the code, please complete this section. Otherwise, delete this section.**
